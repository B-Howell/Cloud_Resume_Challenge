# Cloud_Resume_Challenge

</br> by Forrest Brazeal

The Cloud Resume Challenge is designed as way for newcomers to cloud to get hands on experience with some of the technologies that are commonly used in the day to day of DevOps Engineers. Brazeal purposely only gives a basic overview of the steps you're required to take to complete the challenge. This is meant to incourage self learning. High-level guidance is given on things like Frontend Development, HTTPS, DNS, API's, Testing, IaC, and CI/CD.

</br> While you can also use Azure or GCP, my website is implementied using AWS resources such as: S3, CloudFront, Route 53, API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

</br>To deploy the architecture I used Terraform as my Infrastructure as Code method and GitHub Actions as my CI/CD method.
